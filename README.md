# MeetupsNext.JS
MeetupsNext.JS is a website that allows users to create, save, update, and delete meetups. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing meetup events and utilizes the Next.js framework for efficient server-side rendering.

Key Features:

Meetup Creation: Users can create new meetups by filling out a form that includes details such as title, description, address, and an optional image.

Meetup Storage: The website integrates with a database to store the meetup data securely. MongoDB is used as the database management system to store and retrieve meetup information.

Meetup Listing: A list of existing meetups is displayed on the website, showcasing important details like meetup titles and brief descriptions. Users can quickly browse through the available meetups.

Meetup Details: Clicking on a specific meetup from the list provides more detailed information, including the meetup's full description, address, and image (if provided).

Meetup Update: Users have the ability to update the details of a meetup. They can modify the meetup's title, description, address, or image by accessing the respective fields in the meetup details page.

Meetup Deletion: Users can also delete meetups they have created. This action removes the meetup permanently from the database and removes it from the list of available meetups.

this is where MeetupsNext.JS provides a convenient and efficient way for users to manage meetups, including creation, storage, updating, and deletion, all in a user-friendly interface.
