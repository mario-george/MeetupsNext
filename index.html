<!-- Next JS is a React framework for production
fullstack framework for react
framework is bigger(has more features) than a library

building react apps easier

Nextjs provoide 
1-server side rendering which happens on the server as opposed to client side rendering
which helps search engine crawlers(public content can be caught by the search engine )
2-File based routing
3-fullstack capabilities(database)
easy add server-side code / backend to your app(react/next)
add auth or store/get data



you will find 3 folders in a next project
after runnng in terminal npx create-next-app
pages for routes
style
public for public sources we will use we dont have an index.html because next does prerendering

in pages folder
if you want 3 pages 
root page index.js if / only will run this the path will be our-domain.com/
if you have news.js the path will be our-domain.com/news

Next js supports that you can omit/dont type import React from 'react'
run dev server by npm run dev

if you view page source of any page in next project you wont have empty skeleton(which was the index.html in the root page) like react thats pre-rendering
